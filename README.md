# colorscience

## WARNING

This package is deprecated and will someday be removed.  
I have long thought that it is too big and has some unimportant functions,
so I have been copying the important parts to these packages:

- [**colorSpec**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=colorSpec), with emphasis on spectra
- [**spacesXYZ**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=spacesXYZ), for CIE XYZ and derived spaces
- [**spacesRGB**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=spacesRGB), for various RGB color spaces
- [**munsellinterpol**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=munsellinterpol), for ISCC-NBS color names and centroids

while improving functionality and documentation.
I also added vignettes and tests.

Whenever possible, please use these packages instead.  
If there is a feature in
[**colorscience**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=colorscience)
that you cannot find in one of these 4 packages,
please let me know.
